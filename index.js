/**
 * This is a bit unorthodox, but Hop is set up to export everything
 * from this single file. You can thus import dependencies like:
 *
 *    import { Component, Store, div, h1 } from '@wartman/hop'
 *
 * If you want more control, you could do the following instead:
 *
 *    import Component from '@wartman/hop/src/view/Component'
 *    import { div, h1 } from '@wartman/hop/src/view/elements'
 *
 * Note that I'm sill in the process of figuring out the best way to
 * consume this module, so things might change. For example, it may
 * make sense to break apart the dependency injector, Store and Views
 * into their own NPM modules.
